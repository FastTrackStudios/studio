//! Streamed sources: a take whose audio is decoded a few seconds at a time
//! around the playhead, from compressed bytes held in memory.
//!
//! The browser's answer to [`AudioSource::PcmFile`](super::source::AudioSource):
//! a page has no disk to map, and 21 seven-minute stems decoded whole are
//! 3 GB. So a take's source is a [`Streamed`] — fixed-size chunks of
//! decoded audio, resident only near the playhead — and a
//! [`StreamFeeder`] keeps the chunks ahead of it filled from the take's
//! proxy (an Ogg Vorbis file, see `fts_sample::ogg_stream`). The renderer
//! reads a chunk that is not there yet as silence and says where it is
//! reading ([`Streamed::want`]), which is where the feeder decodes next.
//!
//! Nothing here blocks or spawns: the feeder does a bounded amount of work
//! per [`StreamFeeder::pump`] and whoever drives playback calls it — a
//! browser's render loop, a test.
