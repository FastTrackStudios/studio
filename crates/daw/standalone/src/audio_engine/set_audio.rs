//! The set engine's audio: one output stream that mixes every song of a
//! set, each on its own transport (`docs/design/set-engine.md`, step 1).
//!
//! A [`Voice`] is one song that may sound: its project's realtime
//! [`ProjectRenderer`] (snapshot built when the voice is made, off the
//! audio thread) and the project's own [`TransportShared`]. [`SetAudio`]
//! owns the stream and a [`Voices`] list that control threads swap in
//! whole; the callback only ever `load`s it (no lock, no allocation).
//!
//! Per block ([`render_set_block`]): one [`BufferClock`] stamp; every
//! voice opens the block on its transport with that same stamp
//! (`begin_block`), so a [`ScheduledLocate`] lands on the same frame in
//! every song; the voices that play render their plan into their own
//! block buffer and are summed. A stopped voice costs its `begin_block`.
//! Then, as in the one-song engine (`mixer.rs`), the aux hook (its clock
//! from the *current* voice), the output routing and the device format.
//!
//! **Soft clocks.** Making a voice disables its project's soft clock —
//! the callback drives that transport from then on — and removing it puts
//! the soft clock back as it was. A dead device turns every voice's soft
//! clock back on, so no playhead freezes.
//!
//! **Meters.** A backend has one meter bank, by track index, read as the
//! current project's (`Standalone::meters`, the meter pump). So only the
//! current voice meters ([`ProjectRenderer::set_metering`]); the others
//! render without touching the bank, and while the current voice is
//! stopped its cells fall to silence, as they do in the one-song engine.
//! Making a voice current sizes the bank for its tracks.
//!
//! **Live MIDI** goes to the current voice (the backend has one live-MIDI
//! producer): making a voice current connects its renderer.
//!
//! [`BufferClock`]: daw_transport_sync::BufferClock
