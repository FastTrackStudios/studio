//! One file per project, on Turso.
//!
//! The project is a Loro document — what everyone editing it, on any
//! device, merges — and this is where it lives on disk: one SQLite-format
//! file, written through [Turso](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso),
//! holding
//!
//! ```text
//! meta       key → value              the schema, the project's id
//! blobs      hash → bytes (zstd)      plugin states, MIDI sources, an
//!                                     imported project's verbatim text —
//!                                     once each, however many branches
//!                                     or joined projects refer to them
//! branches   name → parent, base      the song (`main`) and its
//!                                     alternatives and checkpoints, each
//!                                     forked from another at a point
//! updates    seq → branch, update     each undo step's edits, appended
//!                                     to its branch (zstd)
//! snapshots  branch → upto, snapshot  a branch's doc as of its update
//!                                     `upto`, folded by [`Store::compact`]
//! ```
//!
//! A branch is Logic's alternative: `Organized` forked from the song when
//! the organizing was done, edited on its own after. It shares everything
//! before the fork with the song — the history up to there, every blob —
//! and keeps only what it did since.
//!
//! Media is not here: audio stays files beside the project, as it is now.
//!
//! What makes it small is what goes in, not the engine: a project as a
//! Loro doc rather than text, every blob stored once by content, and an
//! alternative a fork of one history rather than a copy of the project. Turso itself does not compress; the blobs and the history are
//! zstd'd here.
//!
//! Turso's API is async; the store drives it to completion on the
//! calling thread, so callers (a save, an open) stay synchronous.
