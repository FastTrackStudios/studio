//! Tracks service trait.
//!
//! Stateless singleton backends — `ProjectContext` flows through every
//! call. `#[architect::rpc]` derives the async vox client + `serve`
//! function; backends impl `Tracks` directly. See
//! `daw-proto/src/marker/service.rs` for the same pattern.
//!
//! Scope was trimmed from the previous async `TrackService` to the
//! verbs the daw-control facade actually drives. Broader surfaces
//! (track chunks, hierarchy apply, ext state, input monitoring,
//! subscribe) land on follow-on sibling traits if/when a real consumer
//! needs them.
