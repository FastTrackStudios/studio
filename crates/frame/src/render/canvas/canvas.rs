//! The painting seam: what frame paints *into*.
//!
//! A host has its own scene type — session records into an anyrender 0.11
//! `Scene` and replays it under a transform; REAPER hands over a LICE
//! bitmap; a test wants pixels. [`Canvas`] is the handful of calls all of
//! them share (anyrender's `PaintScene` shape, in kurbo 0.13 / peniko 0.6,
//! which every one of those hosts already links), so frame paints its
//! primitives straight into the host's scene rather than into a bitmap the
//! host then has to composite.
//!
//! [`Recording`] is frame's own replayable list of those calls: record once
//! when params change, replay every frame under whatever transform the
//! host's scroll and zoom put the strip at — the same model session's mixer
//! uses for everything else it draws.
