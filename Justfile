# The single compiled sheet (assets/tailwind-signal.css) is inlined by
# BOTH apps/session/desktop/src/rig_view.rs (signal UI) and
# src/main.rs SessionChrome (session UI) via include_str!; rebuild it
# whenever UI-crate class usage changes. input.css @source globs scan the
# signal/session UI crates + libs/ui + libs/dock.

# Point apps/{session,signal}/desktop/.lumen-blocks at the lumen-blocks
# checkout cargo actually resolved.
#
# input.css used to reach into $CARGO_HOME with a hardcoded /home/cody path

# in the cache, not the pinned one — four of them here — so the compiled
# sheet depended on which revisions happened to be lying around, and
# changed on its own as the cache moved. That's what kept this file
# permanently dirty. `cargo metadata` knows the real answer; ask it.

# ── Expression editor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The expression editor in a window you keep open, with rsx! hot reload.
# Blitz -> Vello -> winit via dioxus-native: the same renderer the VST3
# editor and the REAPER panel use, without the plugin windowing. Pick the
# file to edit inside the window; set EXPRESSION_EDITOR_LIBRARY to point
# the chooser at a folder of material.
#
# ⚠ RESTART IT AFTER A STRUCTURAL rsx! EDIT. Hot reload replaces the
# template in the running app, and dioxus's template diffing cannot
# handle a template whose *node count* changed — adding or removing an
# element, an `if` block, or a component. The next render walks a
# mutation path into a node that is no longer there and you get
#
#     blitz-dom/src/mutator.rs: invalid key        (node_at_path)
#
# which reads like a bug in whatever key you just pressed and is not:
# the same markup mounts fine from a cold start, and the headless
# suite — which has no hot reload — never sees it. Upstream knows the
# class (DioxusLabs/dioxus#3459, #3567); this is its Blitz spelling,
# because blitz-dom holds nodes in a slab and a stale index there says
# "invalid key" rather than "index out of bounds".
#
# Editing *values* — a colour, a size, a string — hot reloads fine. It
# is only shape. To rule it out entirely: `just ee-serve --hot-reload
# false`, or `just ee` for a one-shot window.

#
# Why this exists: on Wayland a session cannot move the pointer or type
# into a window, so the only way to find out whether a click does what
# you think is to ask a person. Three bugs in the panel's input went
# unnoticed exactly that way — a rename field that opened and could not
# be typed into, a name that reverted on Enter, a control that lit on
# the wrong row. All three showed up in the first minute of driving it.
#
# Xvfb has no GPU, so this renders through llvmpipe at some tens of
# milliseconds a frame. It is for finding out what the window DOES, and
# says nothing whatever about what it costs — measure with
# `just studio-bench`.
#
# Notes that cost an hour each, so they are written down:
#
#   * `setsid`, or the window dies with the shell that started it.
#   * Wait for the WINDOW, not for a number of seconds. `xdotool search`
#     returning an id is the only honest ready signal; the process
#     exists long before it has mapped anything.
#   * There is no window manager on :99, so nothing gives a window the
#     keyboard. `xdotool windowfocus` it first and send keys with
#     `key --window $W`, or every keystroke goes nowhere — which looks
#     exactly like a bug in whatever you are testing.

# The workflow (.github/workflows/checks.yml) is the source of truth;
# this mirrors its steps so a green run here means a green run there.
# It stops at the first failure, because CI does too and a later step
# built on a broken one tells you nothing.
#
# `just ci` runs the lot. `just ci nextest` starts from that step, for
# when you have already passed the cheap ones and are iterating on a
# test. Steps in order: lockfile, fmt, flows, tailwind, check, nextest.
# Filter matches TEST NAMES, not file names, and a filter matching
# nothing exits zero having run nothing — check the count.
#
# Stands up an isolated REAPER under target/fts-reaper-test with only
# daw-bridge in its UserPlugins (built from the sibling ../daw), then
# runs the suites that attach the window to it. Not part of `just ci`
# and not run by CI at all: it needs a licensed REAPER, so it is checked

# ── Releases ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Fleet release flow v4 (the `release-workflow` skill; studio specifics in
# docs/agents/release-workflow.md). `main` is the only long-lived branch:
# every PR squash-merges into it with a cargo-rail change file
# (`cargo rail change add <crates> --bump <none|patch|minor|major> -m
# "<note>"`). A release is a TAG: `release-prepare` cuts `release/pending`
# (ONE commit: the CalVer bump YY.M.MICRO and the CHANGELOG.md section built
# from .changes/), `release-pr` opens it, `release-merge` squash-merges it
# after re-checking it against the current main, and `release-tag` pushes
# `vYY.M.MICRO` once that commit is green, which deploys the sites, uploads
# Signal + Session to TestFlight and publishes the one GitHub Release.
# (The REAPER suites are not in CI: run `just reaper-test` and `just reaper
# daw-test` locally.) Production = the latest `v*` tag.
#
# Signal and Session (the iOS apps) are ONE release with the rest of the
# repo: the same build, the same version (their crates take
# `version.workspace = true`), the same tag and GitHub Release.

# The studio's release version ([workspace.package] in Cargo.toml).
version:
    @bash scripts/release.sh version

# What is live (latest v* tag), what main holds since, the next CalVer
# version, the draft changelog from .changes/ and the git deps that moved.
release-plan:
    bash scripts/release.sh plan

# Cut `release/pending` from origin/main: bump to the next CalVer version,
# write the changelog section from .changes/ (deleting the files), commit
# `chore(release): v<next>`. An X.Y.Z argument only pins the version you
# expect (it must be the computed next one). `--hotfix` cuts from
# origin/release/v<latest tag> instead (after `release-hotfix` merged).

# the release PR (pinned to its head commit).
release-merge:

# After the release PR merged: tag v<version> on its merge commit once
# `Build + test` is green there. THE TAG SHIPS (sites, Signal + Session
# TestFlight, the GitHub Release). After a hotfix it opens the
# forward-port PR into main. Push as the fts-forge bot or a person, not a
# workflow token (that starts no workflow).
release-tag *ARGS:
    bash scripts/release.sh tag {{ARGS}}

# Hotfix while main can't ship: release/v<latest tag> from the tag (if
# missing), the given main commits cherry-picked with -x on a branch, and
# its PR into that line. Then release-prepare --hotfix, release-pr,
# release-merge, release-tag.
