//! Session modes — REAPER-facing action contract.
//!
//! The trait only; `crate::modes::ModeActionsImpl` is the
//! implementation. Same split as `track_manager` / `playback`: the
//! contract and the macro-emitted `ActionMeta` consts +
//! `register_mode_actions` are protocol.
//!
//! The `Mode` enum itself stays in the `session` crate — it carries
//! layout / toolbar logic that doesn't belong in proto. On the wire
//! (see `services::mode`) modes are the stable lowercase slug.

/// The twenty-one mode actions: ten mode switches, ten
/// save-layout-to-screenset variants, and a debug logger.
///
/// Namespace `FTS_SESSION_MODE` renders these as `FTS: Mode - <Name>`
/// rather than nested under Session.
