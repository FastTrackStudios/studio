//! [`SampleEngine`] as the **Sample** [`Soundsource`] — the first-class
//! generator for multisample playback (packs, zone maps, round-robins,
//! mics, legato).
//!
//! This is the MIDI analog of the rig's audio-only [`crate::rig::GuitarRig`]:
//! instead of pass-through processing an input bus, it **generates** audio
//! from MIDI. Hosted on a daw instrument track through the generic
//! [`SoundsourceLeaf`](crate::soundsource::SoundsourceLeaf) adapter, the
//! renderer runs the FX chain every block (the chain is non-empty so the
//! `dirty || !fx_chain` guard keeps it alive), feeds it the block's MIDI
//! events — including live / programmatic ones pushed via
//! `Standalone::push_note_on` — and the instrument writes the rendered
//! voices into the track bus.
//!
//! `in_l` / `in_r` are ignored: a sampler is a source, not an effect.
//!
//! ## Send-safety
//! [`Soundsource`] requires `Send`. [`SampleEngine`] contains only
//! `Cell`/`RefCell` interior mutability (metering counters + a round-robin
//! state cell) over `Send` payloads — these are `Send` (they are merely
//! not `Sync`), and there is no `Rc` anywhere in the engine — so
//! `SamplerInstrument` is `Send`.
