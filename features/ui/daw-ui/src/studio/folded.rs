//! A collapsed folder's own items, folded from its children's.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! A drum kit is a folder tree because that is how the audio has to be
//! routed: a kick is a Sum with three mics under it, a tom is its mic
//! and its trigger. But the routing is a mix concern, and a mix concern
//! is not what an arrangement is for. While you are editing, a kick is
//! **one thing** — the mics were recorded together, comped together and
//! trimmed together, so what you want on screen is one row per drum with
//! the take on it, and the mics available when you go looking for them.
//!
//! REAPER draws nothing on a closed folder, so folding the kit away
//! today means folding the audio away with it. This is what fills that
//! row: the folder keeps its own track control panel — its name, its
//! fader, its colour, because the mix happens there — and the items on
//! it are its children's.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Every boundary of every child, in order; the row is the spans between
//! them that at least one child is sounding across.
//!
//! One rule, and the two cases the desk cares about fall out of it
//! rather than being special-cased:
//!
//! - **The mics agree**, which is the normal case, because they are one
//!   performance. Their boundaries are the same boundaries, so the spans
//!   are the items, and the row looks exactly like the take.
//! - **They do not**, because one mic was punched in, or a trigger lane
//!   was trimmed on its own. Then the extra boundaries appear as extra
//!   spans, and the row says so. It is not a lie about a clean take and
//!   it is not a refusal to draw; it is the edit that is actually there.
//!
//! [`Span::whole`] is what tells the two apart, for anything downstream
//! that wants to draw the second differently.
//!
//! # Why items and not a picture
//!
//! [`crate::studio`]'s sibling `folder_item` module folds children's
//! PEAKS onto a column grid and draws one continuous picture across the
//! folder's whole extent. That is the right answer for an overview and
//! the wrong one here: a picture has no edges to grab, no title, and no
//! gaps between takes. These are real items, so the row hit-tests,
//! labels and selects like every other row, and an edit has somewhere to
//! land.
//!
//! # Editing, which is the point and is not built yet
//!
//! **An edit on a folded item is an edit on every child item under it.**
//! Drag the kick's take and its three mics move together; trim its edge
//! and they all trim to the same boundary; delete it and they all go.
//! That is the whole reason this row is worth having — a view you can
//! read but not work in is a view you stop using — and it is decided,
//! not speculative. It is simply not written yet.
//!
//! Everything it needs is here. A folded item's guid carries the folder
//! and the span ([`guid_of`], [`parse_guid`]), and the span carries the
//! real items ([`Span::from`]). So the path is: the hit test lands on a
//! folded guid, [`parse_guid`] says which fold, [`Span::from`] says which
//! items, and the edit is applied to all of them as ONE undo step.
//!
//! What is genuinely undecided is the ragged case — what trimming the
//! edge of a span where [`Span::whole`] is false should do, when only
//! some of the children start there. That, the undo grouping, and what
//! take lanes mean on a row that has no takes of its own are written up
//! on issue #114.
//!
//! Until then, one invariant holds absolutely: a `folded:` guid names
//! nothing in the session and must never reach the backend. It is a view
//! coordinate, and writing one would address an item that does not
//! exist.
