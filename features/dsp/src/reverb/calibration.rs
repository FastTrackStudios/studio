//! Measured decay → RT60, per engine and per size: what turns a time into
//! the setting that rings it.
//!
//! An engine's `decay` is its own law — a loop gain, or a time computed from
//! line lengths that size then stretches — so the same knob position meant
//! 0.5 s on one engine and 20 s on another, and a time worked out by formula
//! landed 40–80 % long in a small room and a spring asked for 2 s rang 1.2 s
//! in a small tank and 2.2 s in a large one. These tables are what each one
//! actually does, measured through the chain (impulse — a burst for Swell —
//! after the setting has settled, Schroeder decay, T20 × 3, modulation 0.2)
//! at five sizes. The chain maps the user's `decay` across the engine's
//! nominal span (`AlgorithmType::t60_range`, log-spaced) to a time, and
//! hands the engine the setting that measured to that time at the current
//! size, interpolated between the measured ones — so a time is the time
//! heard, whatever the size.
//!
//! Only the rising part of each curve is kept (a flat floor — the early
//! cluster dominating a short tail — and anything past an engine's stable
//! top are dropped), so each row is strictly increasing and invertible. A
//! time an engine cannot reach at a size is held to the nearest it can.
//!
//! The tables are generated (`calibration_tables.rs`): after changing an
//! engine's decay law, re-measure —
//! `cargo run --release -p reverb-dsp --example calibrate > src/calibration_tables.rs`
//! — and check with `cargo run --release -p reverb-dsp --example time_accuracy`.
