//! A text field's hold on the keyboard, so global hotkeys stand aside
//! while it is typed into (`utils::keyboard`).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let keys = use_text_focus();
//! rsx! { input { onfocus: move |_| keys.focus(), onblur: move |_| keys.blur(), … } }
//! ```
//!
//! The hold goes when the field loses focus or unmounts, whichever is
//! first: a field closed mid-edit never leaves the keyboard taken.
//!
//! On dioxus-native the renderer does this for every text input itself
//! ([`follow_text_fields`], called once before launch); the hook stays for
//! fields that are not text inputs to the renderer, and for other hosts.
