//! The notes inside an item, for drawing it.
//!
//! An item's body should be what the item CONTAINS. Audio has peaks and
//! MIDI has notes, and until now every item in the arrangement was
//! drawn from the same synthetic envelope — a function of the track's
//! index and the time, which never touched the item, the take, or a
//! single sample. That is why a chord track looked like a shaker.
//!
//! Notes arrive the way peaks were always meant to: after the window is
//! already standing. Reading them is a round trip per item, and a
//! session with four hundred MIDI items would spend the whole open
//! doing it — so the window draws what it has, asks for the rest, and
//! redraws as the answers land.
