//! Split between the two halves that each know half of it. The widget
//! knows the CONTENT (which tracks are selected, where the items are, the
//! time selection), so it resolves a [`Command`] into a [`Request`] in
//! session units: seconds across, unzoomed pixels down. The panel
//! (`studio.rs`) knows the FRAME (how big the lanes are on screen, the
//! zoom limits) and owns the zoom and scroll signals, so it turns a
//! request into a [`Target`] with [`frame`] and keeps the [`History`]
//! that `z u` / `z r` and the toggles walk.
