//! Which folders are open: the window's own choice over the layout's.
//!
//! The scene decides a first layout (`plan::apply_scene`); a person then
//! opens and shuts folders — from a folder's button in the arrangement or
//! at the foot of its mixer strip — and can fold every top-level folder at
//! once ([`set_tops`]): the whole session as its families, the drums one
//! row and one strip, to see everything that is going on and open only
//! what is being worked on.
//!
//! One state for the window, so the arrangement and the mixer always show
//! the same folders; applied where rows are planned
//! (`studio::plan_rows_with`), so a folder shut here gets its children's
//! items folded onto its row, as a folder the scene shut does. Every
//! change bumps [`generation`], which the views compare each frame to plan
//! their rows again.
