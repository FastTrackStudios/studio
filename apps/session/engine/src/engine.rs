//! Changes, on their way to the engine.
//!
//! The window does not own the session — `daw-standalone` does. A fader
//! drag is not "move the fader", it is "tell the engine this track's
//! volume is now this", and the fader moves because the engine says so.
//!
//! That ordering is the whole point. It is what will let a second
//! window, or a real REAPER over `daw-sync`, see the same change: the
//! engine is the thing both are looking at, and a UI that mutated its
//! own copy would be a UI that disagrees with everyone else the moment
//! anything else touches the session.
//!
//! # Why the edits queue rather than being sent
//!
//! A fader drag fires an event per mouse move — a hundred a second on a
//! trackpad. Sent one RPC each, that is a hundred round trips to
//! deliver one number, ninety-nine of which are already stale when they
//! arrive.
//!
//! So continuous edits COALESCE: the queue keeps the latest value per
//! track and control, and the worker sends what is current when it gets
//! to it. Discrete edits — a mute, a rename — never coalesce, because
//! two mute toggles are two different intentions and collapsing them
//! into one would silently drop half of a double-click.
