//! The engine as a window sees it: one vox service, [`EngineView`], beside
//! the daw facade on the same link.
//!
//! A window never reaches into the engine. It reads the song through the
//! daw facade (`daw::rpc::Daw`) and everything the facade does not carry —
//! the set, the hit markers, the waveforms as the engine draws them, the
//! automation lanes with the leveler's, the streaming state, what the
//! engine asks of a window, the Action List — through this service. The
//! link is a Unix socket to `studio engine` on the desktop, and an
//! in-memory one to an engine in the same process on iOS and in a browser
//! (`architect::LocalServer`): the same client either way, so no window
//! code knows which.
//!
//! Live state comes as `#[subscribe]` streams from the engine's hubs (the
//! set, the overlays, the streaming state, what changed, what a window is
//! asked to do); what a window reads on demand (a waveform's detail at the
//! zoom it draws, a song's lanes) is a call. A frame never waits on
//! either: the window keeps a replica of what it draws
//! (`crate::view_client`).
//!
//! The engine side is `crate::studio_engine::view_host`; the window side
//! `crate::view_client`. See `docs/design/engine-boundary.md`.
