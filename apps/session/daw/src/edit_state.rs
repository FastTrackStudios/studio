//! The edit cursor and the time selection: engine state, one per song.
//!
//! What an edit acts on when it is not told where — an insert at the edit
//! cursor, a quantize over the time selection — so it is the engine's, not
//! a window's: an action run headless (the CLI, a model) reads the same
//! cursor a window shows, and two windows on one engine agree on it. Item
//! and track selection are the project's already (`daw::service::Items` /
//! `Tracks` select); this is the rest of "where the user is".
//!
//! Two writers, told apart:
//!
//! - **a window** [`show`]s where its arrangement has the cursor as it
//!   draws (a click, a drag) — the state follows, nobody is asked to move;
//! - **an action** [`ask`]s for it (`TIME_SELECTION_SET`, an insert that
//!   moves the cursor on): the state moves, and every window takes it up on
//!   its next frame ([`asked_since`] / [`take_asked`]).
//!
//! The pure part is [`EditStates`]; the process's one is behind the free
//! functions, keyed by the song on screen (`crate::open::current_song`).
