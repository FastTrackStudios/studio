//! Where Stop leaves the cursor: where it is, or back where play started.
//!
//! "Return to where play started" is REAPER's "stop moves the edit cursor
//! back to the last start position" — start playing at bar 5, stop, and
//! the cursor is at bar 5 again, so a passage can be played over and over
//! without going back to place the cursor each time. A locate made while
//! playing (a click on the ruler, a jump to a section) is where play
//! starts from now, so it is what Stop returns to.
//!
//! The choice is the window's, process-wide like [`crate::options`], and
//! kept on this device the way [`crate::song_modes`] keeps its modes.
