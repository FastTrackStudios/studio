//! What moves in a rack, and the two things that are expensive to know.
//!
//! The rack's rule is: record what is constant, re-emit what varies,
//! cache what varies sometimes. This module is the third bin. Two
//! pictures in the rack depend on settings alone but cost milliseconds
//! to work out — the saturator's harmonic ladder (a probe through the
//! stage) and the reverb's tail (the algorithm's own impulse response,
//! rendered) — and neither may run inside a frame. Both are memoised
//! here on what they were built from, and the reverb's goes to a worker
//! so a drag on its decay never waits for it.
//!
//! It also holds [`Meters`]: the per-track payload the engine publishes
//! at meter rate, which is everything in a rack that moves with the
//! audio. One struct, so that a unit gaining a live element is a field
//! here and a read in its drawing, not a new channel.
